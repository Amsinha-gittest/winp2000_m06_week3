# Learning About Linux

## Introduction

 This document writes about several key learning and historical literature about Linux world and how it has changed our lives including basic kickstarts with basic commands.


## Section 1. Linux History

- History and Origins of Linux

Linux originated in 1991 by Linus Torvalds with a vision of making an open source platform for an Operating System. It may definetely have initialized by Linus Torvalds but current version of linux is a result of numerous developers who have contributed to this open source platform. 

- Key Contributors and Development

The Key contirbutors, Linus Torvalds being the primary there are whole worlds developers who have contributed in making the linux how it is till date.

- Evolution and Significance

Linux was first just an inception or started as hobby but today with numerous contributions accross the developer community it has been used in every other devices be it, mobile, super computers, Cloud infrastructure and many more.

## Section 2. Linux Distributions

- **What are Linux Distributions?**

A *Linux distribution* (often called a "distro") is a complete operating system built on the Linux kernel, bundled with fucntonal software like system libraries, user interfaces, and utilities. Distributions are vital because they allow users to experience Linux in different ways, tailored to their needs, without requiring them to build the entire system from scratch.

- **Popular Linux Distributions**

**Ubuntu:** One of the most popular and user-friendly distributions, it is based on Debian and is widely used for both desktop and server environments. Known for its ease of use and large community support.

**Debian:** A highly stable and reliable distribution, Debian is the foundation for many other distros, including Ubuntu. It emphasizes free software and is known for its robustness in server environments.

**Fedora:** Developed by the Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat, it is known for being cutting-edge, frequently adopting new technologies before other distributions.

**Arch Linux:** A lightweight, flexible distribution that follows a "rolling release" model, where software is continuously updated. Arch is popular among advanced users who prefer to build and customize their systems from the ground up.

**CentOS:** A free, community-supported distribution that is functionally compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), widely used in enterprise environments.

- **Differences Between Various Distributions**

**User Experience:**

- Ubuntu is known for its beginner-friendly interface, while Arch Linux requires more advanced configuration, offering greater control.
- Fedora focuses on delivering the latest software and innovations, while Debian prioritizes stability and long-term support.

**Package Management:**

- Ubuntu and Debian use the APT package manager, which handles software installation and updates.
- Fedora uses DNF, while Arch Linux employs Pacman, each with different philosophies on software handling.

**Purpose:**

- CentOS and Debian are often favored for server use due to their stability and security.
- Ubuntu and Fedora are popular for desktops, with Fedora being used by developers who want to experiment with cutting-edge technologies.

These differences make Linux distributions adaptable to a wide range of users, from beginners to enterprises and advanced power users.

## Section 3. Basic Linux Commands

Below are the basic linux command which are used to daily usage and comes very handy for new linux user. Below are some of them

1) `ls` - To list the files. It have different function to perform various operations. such as -l shows details of the listed files. -a shows the hidden files and many more.

2) `cd` - This command is used to change the directory.

3) `mkdir` - This commmand is used to make directory

4) `touch` - To create the files

5) `vi <filename>` - This is one of the popular editor and it can be used to write inside the fiel.

6) `cat <filename>` - To read the file content. This command usually when fired copies the content of the file and paste it into the terminal. 

7) `pwd` - To check the current working directory. It prints the absolute path to the current working directory.

8) `cp` - This command copies the file from one directory (path) to another location.

9) `rm` - This command should be used by utter care since executing this command will delete/remove the file/directory.

10) `sudo` - This let the user perform the root user actions. 

#### **Section 3. Conclusion**


This document talks about how linux have changed the world from the time it has been created in 1991 and how crucially this have contributed in changing the technology and the way of using a technology. This OS definitely needs a certain level of expertise to use but once learnt makes your life easy. Linux with have the time have evolved numerously and made the technology really fast. Italso, quotes few basic command which are used numereously even by an experienced Linux user.
